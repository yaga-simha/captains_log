# Repository Overview

## Project Description
- **What this project does**: A simple ratatui terminal UI based log taking app.
- **Main purpose and goals**: 
This app does only 2 things when running 
1. allow writing log entries 
2. Let log entries be listed and seen. 

This TUI will have 2 panels
1. large left panel with all of the main app content about log taking and reading
2. small right panel will show a terminal art / animation of something interesting - like a space ship

In the left panel with, there will be 3 panels in it.
1. Top panel allows writing log entries
2. Middle panel lists log entries in a short one line format
3. The large bottom panel will show the complete log text with ability to scroll.

The app will always be focussed on the left panel elements. The 3 left panel sub-panels will be tab selectable/switchable. On the top log writing panel, hitting ctrl+s will save the log entry. The middle panel will be a scrollable listing of all log entries which are read from the disk. The bottom most panel will have no interaction on it.

- **Key technologies used**: Rust, Cargo, standard library, ratatui.

## Architecture Overview
- High‑level architecture: The application follows a modular design with potential to grow into distinct components (UI, data model, persistence, etc.).
- Main components and relationships:
  - `main.rs` – Entry point; orchestrates startup logic.
  - Future modules will include:
    - `journal.rs` – Data model and file‑system persistence.
    - `ui.rs` – Terminal UI logic (once UI is added).
- Data flow and system interactions: Inputs (keyboard or file system) will be handled in the main loop, with state updates propagated to UI rendering components.

## Directory Structure
- `src/` – Rust source files.
  - `main.rs` – Application entry point.
  - (Planned) `journal.rs`, `ui.rs`.
- `Cargo.toml` – Project metadata and dependency configuration.
- `Cargo.lock` – Locked dependency versions.
- `target/` – Compiled artifacts (generated by Cargo).
- `.gitignore` – Excludes target directory and other build artifacts.

## Development Workflow
- **Build / run**: `cargo run --release` – Compiles in release mode and executes.
- **Testing**: No tests exist yet. Add tests under `tests/` or `src/lib.rs` and run with `cargo test`.
- **Development environment**: Requires Rust 1.56+ (edition 2024). Install Rust via rustup.
- **Lint and format**:
  - Formatting: `cargo fmt`.
  - Linting: `cargo clippy`.
  - Dependency audit: `cargo audit` (once dependencies are added).
